## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Vision
**"Democratize AI Search Visibility"**

GEO Agency is building the first self-serve SaaS platform that enables small and medium businesses (SMBs) to monitor, measure, and optimize their visibility across AI search engines—including ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, and Grok. We solve the industry's most critical unsolved problem: **attribution**. We connect AI citations to actual business outcomes, proving ROI for GEO investments.

### 1.2 Market Opportunity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **TAM** | $50B+ (Digital Marketing Software) |
| **SAM** | $5B (SEO/GEO Tools & Services) |
| **SOM (Year 3)** | $25M ARR |
| **Competitors** | 25+ active players |
| **Market Gap** | SMB self-serve segment is 95% underserved |

The GEO/AEO market is exploding (2024-2026 emergence), yet **95% of competitors target enterprise clients at $10K+/month**. Only one competitor (Geoptie) serves SMBs at $41-166/month—but lacks attribution, cross-platform consistency, and actionable insights. This is our beachhead.

### 1.3 Key Differentiators

1. **Attribution-First Architecture**: The only platform that connects AI citations to revenue (solving the "direct traffic" problem)
2. **Cross-Platform Consistency Engine**: Unified optimization across all major LLMs (not just ChatGPT)
3. **SMB Self-Serve Model**: Transparent pricing, instant onboarding, no sales calls
4. **Actionable Intelligence**: Specific recommendations, not vanity metrics

### 1.4 Investment Highlights

- **First-mover advantage** in SMB self-serve GEO SaaS
- **Unsolved pain point** (attribution) = high willingness to pay
- **Clear monetization path**: Freemium → Pro → Enterprise
- **Network effects**: More users = more citation data = better recommendations

## 2. Competitive Landscape

| **Technology Platforms** | Geoptie, Profound, Evertune | $41-$800+/mo | No attribution, limited cross-platform |

- **Revenue**: $1M-$50M annually
- **Role**: Marketing Manager, CMO, or Growth Lead
- **Industry**: B2B SaaS, E-commerce, Professional Services
- **Pain Level**: High (seeing competitors cited in AI, can't prove GEO ROI)
- **Current Spend**: $500-$5,000/month on SEO/content

**Secondary: Small Agencies (2-10 people)**
- Serving 5-25 clients
- Adding GEO services to existing SEO offerings
- Need white-label reporting (Phase 2)

### 3.2 Prioritized Pain Points

| Rank | Pain Point | Frequency | Business Impact | Current Solutions | Solvability |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Attribution Gap** - Can't connect AI citations to revenue | Very High | Critical | NONE | Hard |
| 2 | **Measurement Challenge** - No way to track AI visibility | Very High | High | Limited (vanity metrics) | Medium |
| 3 | **Cross-Platform Inconsistency** - Different visibility per LLM | High | High | None | Medium |
| 4 | **SMB Affordability** - Enterprise pricing dominates market | High | Medium | Geoptie only (limited) | Easy |
| 5 | **Content Scale** - Manual optimization is resource-intensive | Medium | High | None | Hard |
| 6 | **SEO/GEO Disconnect** - High rankings ≠ AI citations | High | High | None | Medium |
| 7 | **Transparency/Trust** - Skepticism about GEO value | High | Medium | Limited | Easy |

### 3.3 Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Attribution Proof**
> "As a CMO, I need to prove that our GEO investment drives actual revenue so that I can justify increasing our budget in board meetings."

**Use Case 2: Competitive Intelligence**
> "As a marketing manager, I want to know which AI platforms mention my competitors but not me so that I can identify quick-win optimization opportunities."

**Use Case 3: Cross-Platform Consistency**
> "As a content strategist, I need to ensure my brand is visible consistently across all major LLMs so that I don't lose customers regardless of which AI they use."
