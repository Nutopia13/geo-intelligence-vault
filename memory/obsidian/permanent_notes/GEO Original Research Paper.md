# GEO: Generative Engine Optimization (Original Paper)

## Core Concept
The foundational research paper introducing **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** — the first paradigm for optimizing content visibility in AI search engines and LLM responses. Published by researchers from Princeton, MIT, and IIT Bombay at KDD 2024.

## Key Findings

### The Problem
- Traditional SEO optimizes for **ranking** in search results
- GEO optimizes for **citation** and **inclusion** in generative responses
- Content creators have "little to no control over when and how their content is displayed" in generative engines
- The creator economy is at risk without visibility optimization methods

### The Solution
- **GEO-bench**: Large-scale benchmark with diverse queries across multiple domains
- **Black-box optimization framework**: Flexible approach that works without knowing the internal workings of each LLM
- **Domain-specific strategies**: Different optimization methods work better for different domains

### Results
- **Up to 40% boost** in visibility in generative engine responses
- Strategies vary significantly by domain — no one-size-fits-all approach
- First systematic evaluation of content optimization for LLM citations

## Publication
- **Conference**: KDD 2024 (30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining)
- **arXiv**: 2311.09735 (first published Nov 2023, final version June 2024)
- **DOI**: 10.1145/3637528.3671900

## Implications for Strategy
- Early mover advantage: Field is nascent, optimization techniques are still being discovered
- Multi-domain approach needed: Different strategies for different content types
- Black-box optimization suggests these methods will work across different LLM providers (GPT, Claude, etc.)
