# GEO Case Studies & Performance Claims

## ⚠️ Confidence Warning
These claims come from marketing agencies and industry blogs. They should be treated as **unverified** until independently confirmed. Multiple sources make similar claims, but no peer-reviewed case studies exist yet.

## Claimed Results

### Conversion Rate Comparison
| Source | Metric | Claim |
|--------|--------|-------|
| SingleGrain (2025) | AI-sourced vs standard search | 27% vs 2.1% conversion rate |
| Growth.pro | Visibility increase | 472% in 90 days |

### McKinsey Analysis (2025)
- **GEO now essential** for holistic marketing strategy
- Brand's own sites comprise only **5-10%** of AI search sources
- AI search pulls from broad array: affiliates, user-generated content, third-party sites
- Market leaders not guaranteed visibility in AI-powered search

## What These Claims Suggest

### If True:
- GEO could be **10x+ more effective** than traditional SEO for conversions
- Multi-channel content strategy critical (can't rely on owned properties)
- First-mover advantage window is open

### Red Flags:
- No named clients in case studies
- No methodology disclosed
- "AI Citation Engineering" appears to be agency marketing term
- Growth.pro claims 472% increase but doesn't define baseline

## Verified vs Unverified

### Verified ✅
- Original GEO paper shows **up to 40% visibility boost** in controlled study
- Perplexity launched ads in November 2024
- Multiple sources confirm AI search is growing rapidly

### Unverified ⚠️
- 27% vs 2.1% conversion rate claim
- 472% visibility increase in 90 days
- Specific ROI figures from agencies
