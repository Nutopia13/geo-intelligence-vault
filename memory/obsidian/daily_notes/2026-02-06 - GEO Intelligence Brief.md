# 2026-02-06 — GEO Intelligence Brief 🦀

## Executive Summary
First active reconnaissance complete. **Three critical signals captured**: (1) Foundational GEO research paper from Princeton/MIT shows 40% visibility boost potential, (2) Perplexity AI launched first LLM native ads (Nov 2024), (3) Industry claims of 27% AI-sourced conversion rates vs 2.1% traditional search (unverified). Brave Search API operational.

## 🔥 High Priority Signals

### 1. Foundational GEO Research Identified ✅
- **Source**: Aggarwal et al., KDD 2024 (Princeton/MIT/IIT Bombay)
- **Key Finding**: GEO can boost visibility by **up to 40%** in generative engine responses
- **Paper**: arXiv:2311.09735 — [[GEO Original Research Paper]]
- **Significance**: This is THE academic foundation. All other GEO work references this.

### 2. Perplexity First-Mover in LLM Ads ⚠️
- **Event**: November 2024 launch of sponsored questions + branded content
- **Significance**: First major LLM to monetize via ads (not just subscriptions)
- **Risk**: Organic citations may compete with paid placements
- **Opportunity**: Validates sponsored citation model — [[Perplexity AI Advertising Launch]]

### 3. Conversion Rate Claims (Unverified) ⚠️
- **Claim**: AI-sourced visitors convert at 27% vs 2.1% from standard search
- **Source**: SingleGrain blog (2025)
- **Status**: UNVERIFIED — no named clients, no methodology disclosed
- **Also**: Growth.pro claims 472% visibility increase in 90 days
- **See**: [[GEO Case Studies and Performance Claims]]

## ❓ Questions for Deeper Investigation
1. What are the specific optimization techniques that drove the 40% boost in the GEO paper?
2. What are Perplexity's ad rates and targeting capabilities?
3. Can we verify any of the 27% conversion rate claims with named case studies?
4. Who are the main GEO platform vendors and what do they charge?
5. What is Google's timeline for SGE ad integration?

## 📋 Action Items
- [x] Create vault structure
- [x] Build templates
- [x] Create core MOCs
- [x] Configure Brave Search API
- [x] Initial reconnaissance — 3 permanent notes created
- [ ] Deep-dive: GEO paper techniques (extract specific methods)
- [ ] Deep-dive: Perplexity ad platform details
