## 🔗 Connections & Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Ad Wars Have Begun
Perplexity (Nov 2024) → Microsoft Copilot (Early 2025) → Google AI Overviews → OpenAI ChatGPT (Feb 2026) → Anthropic counter-positioning

**Insight**: It's no longer about IF — it's about HOW. Every major LLM is either running ads, testing them, or strategically positioning against them.

### Pattern 2: Google Isn't Blinking
- 57% of Alphabet's $307B revenue comes from search
- $175-185B AI capex commitment for 2026
- AI Overviews already reducing clicks by 58%
- Testing "Direct Offers" inside AI Mode

**Insight**: Google has the most to lose but also the strongest position. They're not waiting to respond — they're already integrating.

### Pattern 3: Attribution Crisis Creates Opportunity
- 75% of marketers dissatisfied with current measurement
- AI search causing 15-38% traffic decreases
- Traditional attribution breaking down as user behavior shifts to conversational AI

**Insight**: The measurement gap is widening. This is exactly the problem Attributr aims to solve.

### Pattern 4: Reddit = Sleeping Giant
- 80M weekly search users (growing 30% YoY)
- 22 billion human-created posts
- Already #1 or top 3 source cited in LLM search
- Planning personalization for logged-out users by Q3 2026

**Insight**: Reddit is becoming a search engine, not just social. Their content is already training LLMs. Monetization inevitable.
