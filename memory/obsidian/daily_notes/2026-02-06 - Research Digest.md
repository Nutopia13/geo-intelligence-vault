### 1. E-GEO: A Testbed for Generative Engine Optimization in E-Commerce
**arXiv:2511.20867 [cs.IR]**  
**Authors:** Yuhang Wu, Puneet S. Bagga et al.  
**Published:** November 25, 2025 (v1)  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20867

**Abstract Summary:**  
Introduces E-GEO, the first benchmark specifically built for e-commerce GEO. Contains 7,000+ realistic multi-sentence consumer product queries paired with relevant listings. Evaluates 15 common rewriting heuristics and develops a lightweight iterative prompt-optimization algorithm. Key finding: optimized prompts reveal stable, domain-agnostic patterns suggesting a "universally effective" GEO strategy exists.

**Key Findings:**
- First dedicated e-commerce GEO benchmark (E-GEO)
- 7,000+ queries with rich intent, constraints, preferences, and shopping contexts
- Evaluated 15 rewriting heuristics with empirical performance comparisons
- Developed iterative prompt-optimization algorithm outperforming baselines
- Discovered stable, domain-agnostic patterns in optimized prompts
- Data and code available at: https://github.com/psbagga17/E-GEO

**Relevance to GEO Agency:** **HIGH**  
- Directly applicable to e-commerce clients
- Provides benchmark dataset for testing GEO strategies
- Identifies potentially "universal" GEO patterns
- Open-source tools available

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Review GitHub repository for practical implementation
- [ ] Evaluate E-GEO benchmark methodology for client use cases
- [ ] Consider citing this paper for e-commerce GEO proposals
- [ ] **Warrants permanent note:** Yes - create dedicated research note

### 2. Generative Engine Optimization: How to Dominate AI Search
**arXiv:2509.08919 [cs.IR]**  
**Authors:** Mahe Chen, Xiaoxuan Wang, Kaiwen Chen, Nick Koudas  
**Published:** September 10, 2025 (v1)  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08919

**Abstract Summary:**  
Comprehensive comparative analysis of AI Search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) vs traditional Google search. Through large-scale controlled experiments, quantifies critical differences in information sourcing. Key finding: AI Search exhibits systematic bias toward Earned media (third-party authoritative sources) over Brand-owned and Social content—stark contrast to Google's balanced mix.

**Key Findings:**
- AI Search heavily favors Earned media over Brand-owned content
- Different AI Search services vary significantly in domain diversity, freshness, cross-language stability
- Sensitivity to query phrasing varies across platforms
- Strategic GEO agenda provided with actionable guidance:
  1. Engineer content for machine scannability and justification
  2. Dominate earned media to build AI-perceived authority
  3. Adopt engine-specific and language-aware strategies
  4. Overcome "big brand bias" for niche players

**Relevance to GEO Agency:** **HIGH**  
- Provides strategic framework for client campaigns
- Documents platform-specific differences (critical for multi-platform GEO)
- Actionable recommendations directly applicable to service offerings
- Validates importance of earned media strategy

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Incorporate findings into client strategy documents
- [ ] Develop engine-specific optimization playbooks based on this research
- [ ] Use for competitive positioning ("big brand bias" insights)
- [ ] **Warrants permanent note:** Yes - core strategic reference

### 3. White Hat Search Engine Optimization using Large Language Models
**arXiv:2502.07315 [cs.IR]**  
**Authors:** Tommy Mordo et al.  
**Published:** February 11, 2025 (v1), updated February 23, 2025 (v2)  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07315

**Abstract Summary:**  
Presents novel white-hat search engine optimization techniques based on generative AI with empirical demonstration of their merits. (Note: Abstract is very brief; full paper would need review for detailed findings.)

**Key Findings:**
- Novel white-hat SEO techniques using LLMs
- Empirical validation provided

**Relevance to GEO Agency:** **MEDIUM**  
- Focus appears to be on traditional SEO rather than generative engines
- "White-hat" approach aligns with ethical GEO practices
- Limited information from abstract

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Review full PDF for applicability to GEO
- [ ] Evaluate if techniques translate to generative engine context

### 4. Large Language Models as Search Engines: Societal Challenges
**arXiv:2512.08946 [cs.CY]**  
**Authors:** Fabian Suchanek et al.  
**Published:** November 24, 2025 (v1)  
**Journal:** SIGIR Forum 2025  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08946

**Abstract Summary:**  
Investigates societal challenges if LLMs replace traditional search engines. Focuses on roles of LLM Providers, Content Creators, and End Users. Identifies 15 types of challenges with current mitigation strategies (technical and legal) and future research opportunities.

**Key Findings:**
- 15 distinct challenge types for LLM-as-search future
- Covers Provider, Creator, and User perspectives
- Published in SIGIR Forum (respected venue)
- Includes legal and technical mitigation strategies

**Relevance to GEO Agency:** **MEDIUM**  
- Provides context on industry challenges that may affect GEO
- Helps understand regulatory/legal landscape
- Not directly actionable for optimization but important for strategic planning

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Review for regulatory/compliance insights
- [ ] Monitor cited challenges that may affect client industries

## 🔬 Researcher Tracking

### Original GEO Paper Authors (Aggarwal et al.)

**Paper:** RLHF Deciphered: A Critical Analysis of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for LLMs  
**Authors:** Shreyas Chaudhari, Pranjal Aggarwal, Vishvak Murahari, Tanmay Rajpurohit, Ashwin Kalyan, Karthik Narasimhan, Ameet Deshpande, Bruno Castro da Silva  
**Published:** September 10, 2025  
**Venue:** ACM Computing Surveys, Volume 58, Issue 2 (Article 53)  
**Link:** https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3743127

**Assessment:** NOT directly GEO-related. This is a survey paper on RLHF, not a follow-up to the GEO work. Authors from the original GEO paper (Aggarwal, Murahari, Rajpurohit, Kalyan, Narasimhan, Deshpande) are present, but topic is different.

**No new direct GEO follow-up studies detected from the original Princeton/Georgia Tech group.**
