# MOC: GEO Techniques

## Overview
Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the practice of optimizing content to appear in and be cited by AI search engines and LLMs. Unlike traditional SEO (optimizing for Google's ranking algorithm), GEO optimizes for:
- **Citation probability** — Will the LLM cite this source?
- **Answer integration** — Will the LLM synthesize this into responses?
- **Authority signaling** — Does the LLM trust this source?

## Core Techniques
<!-- Links to permanent notes -->
- [[Structured Data for LLMs]] — Schema.org, JSON-LD optimization
- [[Statistical Claim Optimization]] — Citing numbers increases citation rates
- [[Technical Fluency Signals]] — How expertise is detected
- [[Source Diversity Strategy]] — Being cited across multiple contexts
- [[Citation Format Optimization]] — How to be quoted accurately

## Key Research
- [[GEO Benchmark Paper]] — The original MIT/Princeton research
- [[Citation Probability Study]] — What drives LLM citations?

## Platform-Specific
- [[Perplexity GEO]] — How Perplexity selects and cites sources
- [[ChatGPT Search GEO]] — Optimization for ChatGPT's search
- [[Google SGE GEO]] — Search Generative Experience

## Metrics & Measurement
- [[GEO KPIs]] — What to track
- [[Citation Tracking Tools]] — How to monitor LLM citations

## Questions We're Tracking
- What is the half-life of GEO-optimized content?
- How do different LLM families (GPT, Claude, Llama) differ in citation behavior?
- Can we A/B test GEO strategies?
